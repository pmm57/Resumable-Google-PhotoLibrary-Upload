# Resumable-Google-PhotoLibrary-Upload
A GAS to use the Google Photo Library resumable upload api
# Overview
After scanning in many photos and naming them with descriptive names I discovered that setting the description in Google Photos was going to be a lot of work.
So I had a look at the API's and wrote a Google App Script to load them up.  Then I hit a problem with a largish file and had to re-write to use the resumable api.
This is the result.
